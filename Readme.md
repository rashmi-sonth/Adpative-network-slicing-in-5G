# 5G Network Slicing: Comparative Approaches

This repository explores two distinct approaches to address resource allocation and Quality of Service (QoS) challenges in 5G network slicing:
1. **Traditional Approach**: Employing established algorithms for deterministic resource management.
2. **Machine Learning Approach**: Leveraging supervised learning and ensemble models to predict slice requirements and optimize resource utilization.

The project focuses on the comparative analysis of these methodologies, highlighting their implementations and performance evaluations.
